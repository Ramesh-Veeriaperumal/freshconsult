namespace :db do
  desc <<-EOS
    Loads seed data for the current environment. It will look for
    ruby seed files in <Rails.root>/db/fixtures/ and 
    <Rails.root>/db/fixtures/<RAILS_ENV>/.

    By default it will load any ruby files found. You can filter the files
    loaded by passing in the SEED environment variable with a comma-delimited
    list of patterns to include. Any files not matching the pattern will
    not be loaded.
    
    You can also change the directory where seed files are looked for
    with the FIXTURE_PATH environment variable. 
    
    Examples:
      # default, to load all seed files for the current environment
      rake db:seed
      
      # to load seed files matching orders or customers
      rake db:seed SEED=orders,customers
      
      # to load files from Rails.root/features/fixtures
      rake db:seed FIXTURE_PATH=features/fixtures

    SeedFu::PopulateSeed.populate
