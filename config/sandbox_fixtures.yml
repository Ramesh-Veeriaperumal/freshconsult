    - subject: Defective boomerangs getting lost
      description: Hello team, Over the past 6 months, you’ve been our sole manufacturing partner for boomerangs of various sizes and materials. We’ve been packaging and selling them to our customers as Acme certified products, with the tagline “a guaranteed return on your investment”. Recently, we’ve had our customers tell us that their boomerangs don’t return to them as expected. This is quite embarrassing for a company like Acme Corporation known for it’s highly reliable products. Can you please explain how this is possible? Our team is concerned that the Prodigal Child tracking chip in these boomerangs may not be working properly. But there’s no way to be sure because the boomerangs have disappeared and we cannot get them returned for inspection.  Can you please help us identify the problem and advise us on how to proceed?Regards,Rachel Doe,Vendor Management,Acme Inc.

    - subject: I'm always being charged twice
      description: Hello there, Whenever I try to make a payment with my credit card, I'm being charged twice. Though I get a refund from your team after two days, it does not seem to be the right way. Recently, I purchased for $130,  and I was charged twice. I'm yet to get a refund this time. It has been three days since I made my purchase. I'm really concerned about this and it's really tedious to keep following up. I do know that I will get the refund, but I'm bothered that this is happening every single time. My recent order number is - AC789BGKindly resolve this issues from your end and keep me posted about the refund.Thanks,Amy Thomas

    - subject: Your tarts are always shattered
      description: Hello Pantry box,My customer always complaining about your custard tarts and salted caramel tarts. We know that no one can compete against Pantry box but when ever someone orders a tart it's always shattered. Recently a customer called us and he mentioned that they received your tarts inverted and the custard was spilled all over the box. Also, a couple of them were shattered. Can you identify the issues in packaging? Our customer rely on us when we sell items from others. Thanks,Adrain Jensen
