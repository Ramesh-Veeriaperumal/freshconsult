Click on the <b>New Stream</b> button to add a social stream, and customize it for your specific needs.

      info_1: The ticket form helps capture the data you need from the customer when they submit a ticket. You can customize your Ticket Form to include the right ticket fields for your business, and let your customers and agents fill in the information you need in the format you want. For example, in an e-commerce company, getting a customer's order ID in the ticket form would be very helpful to the agent solving the ticket.

      info2: Dependent Fields give you an easy way to create deeper ticket categories and identify the biggest issues that clog your support.  With dependent fields you can organize tickets hierarchically  into categories, subcategories and item affected. Sit delectus nam non velit distinctio nesciunt incidunt amet commodi soluta sit est in.Corrupti d
      info4: If you are in the estate plan or above, you can have dynamic fields that appear based on the option selected in the type field. For every option in the type field, you can create a different section. You can then add more ticket fields to each section. For example, in an ecommerce scenario, when the type is chosen as "Replacement", a section with a field called "Reason" can open up that will collect the reason why customer needs a replacement for the item. <a target='_blank' href='https://support.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/212889-creating-your-dynamic-ticket-forms'>Read more about dynamic fields</a>.

      info4_v3: If you are in the Estate plan or above, you can have sections with dynamic fields appear based on the option selected in a dropdown field. You can add ticket fields to each section, and associate a section with options in the dropdown field. If you run an e-commerce store, for example, you can have a section open up with a field called 'Reason' when your customer chooses the option 'Replacement'. This way, you can better understand why your customer would like to have a replacement issued. You can create a maximum of two dynamic sections and use them in two custom dropdowns. If you've associated a section with the 'type' field already, you'll be able to add just one more section to the ticket form.

For example, you could have your customers calls forwarded to your Support team when they press 1, and to somebody from Sales when they press 2.<br/>Additionally, you can also customize the messages that will be played back to your customers by recording your voice, uploading a file or using the text-to-speech feature.<br><br><b>Customizing your number</b><br>You could also configure each and every phone number separately and let it have it\xE2\x80\x99s own set of customizations. This includes basic settings such as the maximum number of people on the queue and maximum waiting time for your customers. Once either of them are reached, a non-availability message will be played to your customers automatically.<br/>When you enable call recording, every phone call across your helpdesk is recorded and attached to your tickets, and the recording can be publicly available to customers or kept private. You can also restrict your phone channel from taking calls during non-business hours. For example, you could set up two support lines, one of which will be available to take calls only during working hours, and another high-priority helpline that will be available 24x7.<br/><br/><a href='http://support.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/169198' target='_blank'>Read more about customizing your number</a> Sit delectus nam non velit distinctio nesciunt incidunt amet commodi soluta sit est in.Corrupti dicta laborum aliquid minima eligendi aut non consequatur ut soluta tenetur omnis dolorem.Eos sed ex soluta ut iusto illum et qui fuga itaque consectetur sit officia.Temporibus voluptatem praesentium voluptate hic asperiores aperiam tempora sequi dolores perspiciatis enim dolores.Sed veniam laborum dolores mollitia ipsam voluptates voluptatem corporis consequatur doloremque sit quaerat tenetur.Tempora sit aliquam vel dolore est vel architecto neque id ut ut voluptates voluptas.Esse distinctio"

          <p>Dear Mr James Dean (Like the Actor),</p><br /><p>Thank you for your email detailing your unfortunate events following the delay of your luggage. Please accept my sincerest apologies for this, and for the unexpected inconveniences caused as a result. I do hope that despite this, you had a pleasant trip.</p><br /><p>Thankfully, the following morning, it was me that you spoke to,and I advised you that your cat hadbeen found and was on its way to you. On a serious note though James,I'm happy to give you a Tier Point. I hope you cherish it. Like it's Magic.I have also added the mileage and remaining tier points from your most recentflight with us, which means that you are now a Gold Member (not like the movie).</p><br /><p>Please once again accept my sincerest apologies. This experience is not typical of us, and I hope it has not discouraged you from travelling with us again, as it would certainlybe a pleasure to welcome you back on board.</p><br /><p>Yours sincerely,
