        You can organize agents into specific groups such as Sales and Product
        Management. Segmenting agents into divisions lets you easily assign
        tickets, create specific canned responses, manage workflows and generate
        group-level reports. Note that an agent can be a member of multiple
        groups.
      info12: >-
        An agent in Freshdesk is anybody who needs to access, work on and
        resolve your support tickets. The list shows all agents currently in
        your helpdesk. Hover over an agent to edit details, or click on New
        Agent to add a new agent. Agents you add will receive an email with a
        confirmation link to activate their account after which they can access
        and respond to tickets.

        whole month for such agents.
      info13: >-
        You can choose whether your agents will be accessing your support portal
        full-time, or be logging in only occasionally. Occasional agents will
        use up a Day Pass for each day they login to your support portal. You
        can purchase Day Passes in bulk from the Admin tab. Note that you will
        only be billed for the number of full-time agents you add in the plans

      You can organize your agents into specific Groups like “Support” and
      “Sales”. This lets you easily assign tickets, create specific canned
      responses, manage workflows and generate group-level reports. Note that an
      agent can be a member of multiple groups.

  ticket_field:
    helpcard:
      info4_v3: >-
        If you are in the Estate plan or above, you can have sections with
        dynamic fields appear based on the option selected in a dropdown field.
        You can add ticket fields to each section, and associate a section with
        options in the dropdown field. If you run an e-commerce store, for
        example, you can have a section open up with a field called 'Reason'
        when your customer chooses the option 'Replacement'. This way, you can
        better understand why your customer would like to have a replacement
        issued. You can create a maximum of two dynamic sections and use them in
        two custom dropdowns. If you've associated a section with the 'type'
        field already, you'll be able to add just one more section to the ticket
        form.
      title2: Dependent Fields
      tour: Help me understand ticket fields
      info_1: >-
        The ticket form helps capture the data you need from the customer when
        they submit a ticket. You can customize your Ticket Form to include the
        right ticket fields for your business, and let your customers and agents
        fill in the information you need in the format you want. For example, in
        an e-commerce company, getting a customer's order ID in the ticket form
        would be very helpful to the agent solving the ticket.
      title3: Dynamic Fields
      info2: >-
        Dependent Fields give you an easy way to create deeper ticket categories
        and identify the biggest issues that clog your support.  With dependent
        fields you can organize tickets hierarchically  into categories,
        subcategories and item affected.
      title1: Ticket Fields
      info4_v2: >-
        If you are in the estate plan or above, you can have dynamic fields that
        appear based on the option selected in the type field. For every option
        in the type field, you can create a different section. You can then add
        more ticket fields to each section. For example, in an ecommerce
        scenario, when the type is chosen as "Replacement", a section with a
        field called "Reason" can open up that will collect the reason why
        customer needs a replacement for the item.

          Each skill should be assigned to a set of agents as well as mapped to
          tickets matching certain conditions.<br><br>You can assign skills to
          agents based on their expertise or abilities. For example, if you
          support multiple languages, you can create a skill named 'Fluent in
          Spanish' for agents who handle Spanish tickets. To map skills to
          tickets, you can use conditions based on ticket properties like type,
          source, product, or customer properties like requester name, email,
          company. So, tickets that use Spanish as the request language can be
          mapped to the skill 'Fluent in Spanish'.<br><br>If the skill mapped to
          a ticket matches an agent's skill, the ticket will be assigned to the
          agent.

        title3: Skill to Ticket Mapping
        info3: >-
          Skill rules are used to identify which skill should be associated with
          a ticket, based on ticket or customer properties. For each ticket
          assigned to a group, the first matching skill rule in the Skill List
          will be executed. Admins can reorder the list of skills to have the
          most important rules on top.
        info1: >-
          Skills allow you to easily match tickets to the right agents. You can
          associate distinct skills to each agent and create rules to make sure
          that only tickets matching those skills are assigned to them.

          If you support multiple products, you can link a different social

          account. For example, you can make the tweets mentioning
          @yourproduct_france  visible only to your France support agent group.
          The stream for this account will contain all your @mentions and will
          be shown in your social tab. Your DMs will be converted to tickets,
          and you can assign them to a specific agent group. You can set up a

          handles to narrow your search. For example, you may not want to see
          tweets by your marketers or executives in the custom stream you
          created to monitor support queries coming in through your brand and
          brand acronyms.Each stream can be made visible to one or many agent
          groups. You can also pick the default reply handle for each stream.

          The tweets coming in through these social streams can be filtered
          further using certain keywords and converted to tickets automatically.
          They can even be assigned to groups and products. You can set up more
          than one rule and the first rule that the tweet satisfies will get
          executed. For example, you can convert tweets mentioning “switching
          to” with your competitors names into tickets and escalate them to your
          support team head.
        info2: >-
          Social streams are a set of keywords you can monitor from your
          Freshdesk account, other than the accounts you have added. It lets you
          track support questions coming in through tweets that do not even
          mention your brand. If you are just starting out or have a support
          team that doubles up as your marketing team, you can even create a
          stream to monitor your business space and competitors. Click on the
          <b>New Stream</b> button to add a social stream, and customize it for
          your specific needs. For example, you can create a stream called
          "Support" and add your brand acronym and commonly used brand
          misspellings. All these tweets can be seen in your Social tab and you
          can reply to them using any of your integrated twitter accounts.

          You can nominate whether you want an agent to have access to settings
          under the Admin tab. Agents with admin access can be Operation Agents
          with limited access, or Super Admins with the ability to edit all
          configurations. You can have as many Super Admins with the ability to
          view and modify your billing details, or as few as one.
        title2: Admin Privileges
        info2: >-
          For example, you can create a role for your Support Co-ordinators,
          allowing them to update fields and assign tickets, and even add notes
          internally, but not reply to customers.
        title1: Understanding Roles
        info1: >-
          Roles allow you to create and edit access permissions for agents. You
          can create new roles, specify what actions agents with these roles can
          perform within your help desk, and assign the role to agents.
        info3: >-
          Once you create and save a new Role you will be able to assign it to
          agents when you create or edit their profile by clicking on the Agents

        agents and the requester when specific events occur. These notifications
        can be customized and dynamic content can be added using placeholders.

        notes to their tickets with a customized email with a link to the
        ticket.<br/><br/>If your plan supports multi-language, you will be able

      title: Organizing your community
      para2: >-
        For example, when you have a single support portal for your brand, you
        can create multiple categories for products or teams. This will help you
        drive relevant conversations to all of your top-level sections and as an
        administrator, you will still get to manage everything from one place.
      para4: Learn more about multiple products in Freshdesk.
      para3: >-
        If you have multiple product portals configured in your Freshdesk
        account, you can choose to have one of your categories linked to that
        product. Once you do, users will be able to see that category, its
        forums and all its topics both on your main portal as well as on the
        product portal.
      para1: >-
        Categories are top level hierarchies that let you broadly classify your
        community and target your discussions to different types of audiences.
    topics:
      helpnote:
        para3: >-
          Additionally, agents in your team can create announcements to get the
          word out about a new release or campaign.
        title: Driving discussions with topics
        para1: >-
          You can let your users start new topics in your community and talk to
          each other about your product on business.
        para4: >-
          Forum topics can also be marked as a sticky when you want them to be
          featured prominently, and they can be locked to prevent more users
          from adding replies.
        para2: >-
          Based on the type of your forum, your topics can be anything including
          ideas, questions or problems and they can be started by both agents
          and customers. Based on your discussions, you’ll be able to get an
          idea of how many people are facing the same kind of issue, who is
          eager to beta test your new features or what part of your product is
          hard to understand.

          For example, an idea forum called &ldquo;Feature Requests&rdquo; can
          have users suggesting new ideas and voting on them, and a problem
          forum called &ldquo;Bug Reports&rdquo; can have issues and people
          indicating that they are are facing the problem. You can learn more

          Freshdesk lets you create four types of forums: announcements, ideas,
          questions and problems. Each of these types represent a collection of
          topics falling under the same umbrella.
        para1: >-
          Forums let you create specific sections in your community to address
          different types of discussions with your users.

            numbers from various countries and setup toll-free helplines inside
            Freshdesk without using any third party service. You will be charged
            standard rates for incoming, outgoing and forwarding calls from your
            helpdesk. Check out the <a

            calls will be distributed to agents who are logged in to your
            helpdesk. In addition, your agents can choose to pick up phone calls
            from inside the browser or have them forwarded to their desk phone

          <b>Assigning phone calls to agents and groups</b></br>You can set up
          an interactive voice response system (IVR) and route calls to
          different groups or agents in your team. For example, you could have
          your customers calls forwarded to your Support team when they press 1,
          and to somebody from Sales when they press 2.<br/>Additionally, you
          can also customize the messages that will be played back to your
          customers by recording your voice, uploading a file or using the
          text-to-speech feature.<br><br><b>Customizing your number</b><br>You
          could also configure each and every phone number separately and let it
          have it’s own set of customizations. This includes basic settings such
          as the maximum number of people on the queue and maximum waiting time
          for your customers. Once either of them are reached, a
          non-availability message will be played to your customers
          automatically.<br/>When you enable call recording, every phone call
          across your helpdesk is recorded and attached to your tickets, and the
          recording can be publicly available to customers or kept private. You
          can also restrict your phone channel from taking calls during
          non-business hours. For example, you could set up two support lines,
          one of which will be available to take calls only during working
          hours, and another high-priority helpline that will be available
          24x7.<br/><br/><a

    title: Live Chat
    info1: >-
      Freshdesk's integrated Live Chat solution lets you view and chat with
      users on your website, online software, or support portal directly from
      within Freshdesk. You can customize the whole chat window (including
      default texts, color, etc) and even proactively initiate chat sessions
      when visitors spend more time on your site.
    info2: >-
      Each chat session will capture meta information about visitors including
      their location, device, etc and their support history with you. Once you
      finish a chat session, you can choose to convert the conversation into a
      ticket and continue following up with the visitor over email, or archive
      the chat transcript.
