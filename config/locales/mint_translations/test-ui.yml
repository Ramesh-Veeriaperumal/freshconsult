      Got it? Great! Now everytime your customers send you an email here, you’ll have it appear as a ticket in Freshdesk automatically!
      <br><br>
      If your helpdesk did not show you a new ticket, first make sure that you have configured all your emails in this id to get forwarded to your Freshdesk support id ( "%{to_email}" ).
