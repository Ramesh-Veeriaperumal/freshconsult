        title1: Understanding Roles
        info1: Roles allow you to create and edit access permissions for agents. You can create new roles, specify what actions agents with these roles can perform within your help desk, and assign the role to agents.
        info2: For example, you can create a role for your Support Co-ordinators, allowing them to update fields and assign tickets, and even add notes internally, but not reply to customers. 
        info3: Once you create and save a new Role you will be able to assign it to agents when you create or edit their profile by clicking on the Agents icon under the admin tab.
        title2: Admin Privileges
        info4: You can nominate whether you want an agent to have access to settings under the Admin tab. Agents with admin access can be Operation Agents with limited access, or Super Admins with the ability to edit all configurations. You can have as many Super Admins with the ability to view and modify your billing details, or as few as one.

    info1: Setting up your business hours in Freshdesk allows you to have more control over your SLAs. For eg. if your helpdesk works between 9am to 6pm Mon-Fri and a customer sends a high priority ticket at 4pm on Tuesday, with a SLA target resolution time of 4 hours, then the ticket Due By time is set as 11am on Wednesday.You can configure your SLAs to either respect or ignore business hours
    info2: Holidays work exactly like business hours. For eg. if your helpdesk works between 9am to 6pm Mon-Fri and a customer sends a medium priority ticket at 8pm on Friday with a SLA target resolution time of 24 hours, then the ticket Due By time is set as 9am on Tuesday.(not 8pm on Sat)
