        title1: "Adding social accounts"
        info1: "Add Twitter accounts to your helpdesk and manage them along with your support tickets. You can convert your incoming tweets (@mentions) and direct messages into tickets and assign them automatically to specific groups. Click on an account to define ticket rules for converting tweets to tickets."
        info2: "Social streams are a set of keywords you can monitor from your Freshdesk account, other than the accounts you have added. It lets you track support questions coming in through tweets that do not even mention your brand. If you are just starting out or have a support team that doubles up as your marketing team, you can even create a stream to monitor your business space and competitors. Click on the <b>New Stream</b> button to add a social stream, and customize it for your specific needs. For example, you can create a stream called \"Support\" and add your brand acronym and commonly used brand misspellings. All these tweets can be seen in your Social tab and you can reply to them using any of your integrated twitter accounts."
        title2: "Proactive support using social streams"
        handle_title1: "Integrating a Twitter account"
        handle_info1: "If you support multiple products, you can link a different social account to each product. You can manage the visibility of each account. For example, you can make the tweets mentioning @yourproduct_france  visible only to your France support agent group. The stream for this account will contain all your @mentions and will be shown in your social tab. Your DMs will be converted to tickets, and you can assign them to a specific agent group. You can set up a ticket threading interval so that multiple DMs from the same person within that time interval can be merged into one ticket."
        handle_title2: "Converting specific tweets to tickets automatically"
        handle_info2: "You can convert tweets with certain keywords into tickets automatically using Ticket Rules. For example, every tweet mentioning your twitter handle with the words “not working” or “bug” could be converted into tickets and assigned to the “Bug report” group. And you can create another rule for tweets containing the words “system down” and assign them to your “Dev ops” group. The first rule satisfied will be executed. You can also link these tickets to specific products."
        stream_title1: "Defining social streams"
        stream_info1: "You can create multiple streams to search for different sets of keywords on Twitter. Enter the main keywords you want to look for, based on your business and even exclude certain keywords, hashtags and handles to narrow your search. For example, you may not want to see tweets by your marketers or executives in the custom stream you created to monitor support queries coming in through your brand and brand acronyms.Each stream can be made visible to one or many agent groups. You can also pick the default reply handle for each stream."
        stream_title2: "Converting specific tweets to tickets automatically"
        stream_info2: "The tweets coming in through these social streams can be filtered further using certain keywords and converted to tickets automatically. They can even be assigned to groups and products. You can set up more than one rule and the first rule that the tweet satisfies will get executed. For example, you can convert tweets mentioning “switching to” with your competitors names into tickets and escalate them to your support team head."

          content1:
            info1: Mobihelp is Freshdesk’s mobile SDK which makes it easier for you to provide in-app support to your mobile customers.
            info2: Once you integrate MobiHelp, your users will be able to see a dedicated support section within your app. This will include your knowledge base, and a ticket form so that they can get in touch with you if they need help.
            info3: MobiHelp is completely configurable. You can select everything - from the fields in your feedback form to the way it looks inside your app. Information like device name, operating system and app version are collected automatically without any effort of the user. You can also enable custom data fields and collect crash logs and breadcrumb trails.
            info4: You can create an unlimited number of applications to be used with MobiHelp and tie them to your Freshdesk account. Once you do, you can manage all your incoming requests from a single helpdesk.
            info5: Please make sure that you follow our integration guide to learn how you can integrate the SDK into your app.

        info1: Roles allow you to create and edit access permissions for agents. You can create new roles, specify what actions agents with these roles can perform within your help desk, and assign the role to agents.
        info2: For example, you can create a role for your Support Co-ordinators, allowing them to update fields and assign tickets, and even add notes internally, but not reply to customers.
        info3: Once you create and save a new Role you will be able to assign it to agents when you create or edit their profile by clicking on the Agents icon under the admin tab.
        title2: Admin Privileges
        info4: You can nominate whether you want an agent to have access to settings under the Admin tab. Agents with admin access can be Operation Agents with limited access, or Super Admins with the ability to edit all configurations. You can have as many Super Admins with the ability to view and modify your billing details, or as few as one.

      setup: Setting up your helpdesk
      info1: You can completely customize your Freshdesk help desk for customers logging into your self-service portal as well as your agents. Rebrand the look and feel of your helpdesk with your logo and theme by uploading your logo and favicon, giving your help desk a name, and customizing your portal colors.
      info2: You probably want your customers and support agents to access your support portal in your own domain. You can point your support URL at yourcompany.freshdesk.com to your own domain, like support.mycompany.com.
      info3: "All basic settings of your helpdesk can be customized here such as - language, time zone and colour schemes."
      info4: The 'Edit Portal' option will let you configure the portal for your product.

      feedback:
        budget: I don’t have the budget anymore
        budget_followup: You can downgrade to a lower plan in Freshdesk without affecting your existing tickets. In fact, if the budget is really tight, you could move to the Sprout plan with 3 free agents for life. <a href="http://www.freshdesk.com/free-support-software">Learn more about the free plan</a>
        budget_extra: Perhaps you'd like us to hold on to this account for sometime, till you get your wallet back?
        requirement: Freshdesk does not handle some of my requirements
        requirement_followup: We are constantly adding more features and enhancements to Freshdesk. Have you tried suggesting your feature idea in our forums? Or perhaps what you’re looking for is just a few weeks away? <a href="https://support.freshdesk.com/support/discussions/forums/6">Browse our Forum</a>
        requirement_extra: Drop us a couple of lines on what you were looking for, and we'll try and move it up our queue real quick
        moving: We are moving to another product
        moving_followup: We really hate to see you go. Was it the features? The price? That bad bad marketing guy who keeps spamming you? But well, if you’ve made up your mind for someone else, we can only hope you’ll be back soon.
        moving_extra: A line or two on what made you switch would go a long way in helping us build a better product for you
        support: We did not receive good support
        support_followup: We’re sorry. As a customer support company, there’s nothing more important to us than giving you a great support experience, every time. We can only request you to give us another chance to make it up to you.
        support_extra: Give us a few more details and we'll make sure the right support rep repents. A ticket ID? Or Issue?
        else: Anything else?
        else_followup: A couple of lines explaining your problem would be nice..

      info3: Agents you add will receive an email with a confirmation link to activate their account after which they can be assigned, and respond to tickets.
      title1: Full-time vs Occasional Agents
      info4: You can choose whether your agents will need access to your support portal full-time, or will only be logging in occasionally. Occasional agents will use up a Day Pass for each day they login to your support, and you can purchase Day Passes in bulk from the Admin tab. Note that you will only be billed monthly for the number of full-time agents you add.
      info5: Learn more about Day Passes
      title2: Agent Scopes and Roles
      info6: You can choose which tickets your agents can see by modifying their Ticket Scope. You should also specify what actions this agent should be able to perform within your helpdesk by choosing a Role.

You can set SLA policies for the time within which agents should respond to, and resolve tickets based on ticket priorities. You can choose whether you want each SLA rule to be calculated over calendar hours or your business hours.</p> <p>Your SLA Policies will be used in Freshdesk to determine the “Due By” time for each ticket.</p>'

Or have a special policy for customers having priority subscriptions with you. If you are supporting multiple brands or products, you can also have a different SLA workflow for each product.</p>

    title: Business Hours
    info1: Business Hours give you more control over SLAs in your helpdesk, and when a ticket is due. For example, if your helpdesk works between 9am to 6pm Mon-Fri and a customer logs a ticket at 7pm on Tuesday, the "Due by" timers do not start ticking till Wednesday morning at 9
    info2: Holidays work exactly like business hours. If your helpdesk works between 9am to 6pm Mon-Fri and a customer sends a medium priority ticket at 8pm on Friday with a resolution time of 24 hours, then the ticket Due By time is set as 9am on Tuesday.(not 8pm on Sat)
    multiple_info: You can also create multiple sets of business hours and holidays, and apply them for specific groups. If you have one support team working on PST and another on GMT, you can let each group have its own set of business hours and holidays. <a href="https://support.freshdesk.com/solution/articles/98945" target="_blank">Learn more</a>

For example, you could have your customers calls forwarded to your Support team when they press 1, and to somebody from Sales when they press 2.<br/>Additionally, you can also customize the messages that will be played back to your customers by recording your voice, uploading a file or using the text-to-speech feature.<br><br><b>Customizing your number</b><br>You could also configure each and every phone number separately and let it have it’s own set of customizations. This includes basic settings such as the maximum number of people on the queue and maximum waiting time for your customers. Once either of them are reached, a non-availability message will be played to your customers automatically.<br/>When you enable call recording, every phone call across your helpdesk is recorded and attached to your tickets, and the recording can be publicly available to customers or kept private. You can also restrict your phone channel from taking calls during non-business hours. For example, you could set up two support lines, one of which will be available to take calls only during working hours, and another high-priority helpline that will be available 24x7.<br/><br/><a href='http://support.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/169198' target='_blank'>Read more about customizing your number</a>"

      para1: "Categories are top level hierarchies that let you broadly classify your community and target your discussions to different types of audiences."
      para2: "For example, when you have a single support portal for your brand, you can create multiple categories for products or teams. This will help you drive relevant conversations to all of your top-level sections and as an administrator, you will still get to manage everything from one place. "
      para3: "If you have multiple product portals configured in your Freshdesk account, you can choose to have one of your categories linked to that product. Once you do, users will be able to see that category, its forums and all its topics both on your main portal as well as on the product portal. "
