For example, if you support multiple languages, you can create a skill named 'Fluent in Spanish' for agents who handle Spanish tickets. To map skills to tickets, you can use conditions based on ticket properties like type, source, product, or customer properties like requester name, email, company. So, tickets that use Spanish as the request language can be mapped to the skill 'Fluent in Spanish'.<br><br>If the skill mapped to a ticket matches an agent's skill, the ticket will be assigned to the agent."

Click on an account to define ticket rules for converting tweets to tickets."

It lets you track support questions coming in through tweets that do not even mention your brand. If you are just starting out or have a support team that doubles up as your marketing team, you can even create a stream to monitor your business space and competitors. Click on the <b>New Stream</b> button to add a social stream, and customize it for your specific needs. For example, you can create a stream called \"Support\" and add your brand acronym and commonly used brand misspellings.

          content1:
            info1: Mobihelp is Freshdesk’s mobile SDK which makes it easier for you to provide in-app support to your mobile customers.
            info2: Once you integrate MobiHelp, your users will be able to see a dedicated support section within your app. This will include your knowledge base, and a ticket form so that they can get in touch with you if they need help.
            info3: MobiHelp is completely configurable. You can select everything - from the fields in your feedback form to the way it looks inside your app. Information like device name, operating system and app version are collected automatically without any effort of the user. You can also enable custom data fields and collect crash logs and breadcrumb trails.
            info4: You can create an unlimited number of applications to be used with MobiHelp and tie them to your Freshdesk account. Once you do, you can manage all your incoming requests from a single helpdesk.
            info5: Please make sure that you follow our integration guide to learn how you can integrate the SDK into your app.

        title1: Understanding Roles
        info1: Roles allow you to create and edit access permissions for agents. You can create new roles, specify what actions agents with these roles can perform within your help desk, and assign the role to agents.
        info2: For example, you can create a role for your Support Co-ordinators, allowing them to update fields and assign tickets, and even add notes internally, but not reply to customers.
        info3: Once you create and save a new Role you will be able to assign it to agents when you create or edit their profile by clicking on the Agents icon under the admin tab.
        title2: Admin Privileges
        info4: You can nominate whether you want an agent to have access to settings under the Admin tab. Agents with admin access can be Operation Agents with limited access, or Super Admins with the ability to edit all configurations. You can have as many Super Admins with the ability to view and modify your billing details, or as few as one.

      info1: You can completely customize your Freshdesk help desk for customers logging into your self-service portal as well as your agents. Rebrand the look and feel of your helpdesk with your logo and theme by uploading your logo and favicon, giving your help desk a name, and customizing your portal colors.
      info2: You probably want your customers and support agents to access your support portal in your own domain. You can point your support URL at yourcompany.freshdesk.com to your own domain, like support.mycompany.com.
      info3: "All basic settings of your helpdesk can be customized here such as - language, time zone and colour schemes."
      info4: The 'Edit Portal' option will let you configure the portal for your product.
      info5: You can restrict the access to your helpdesk to the contacts that you add and to certain domains. Others will not be able to sign up, log in or submit tickets. You can read more about it
      info6: here.

      feedback:
        budget: I don’t have the budget anymore
        budget_followup: You can downgrade to a lower plan in Freshdesk without affecting your existing tickets. In fact, if the budget is really tight, you could move to the Sprout plan with 3 free agents for life. <a href="http://www.freshdesk.com/free-support-software">Learn more about the free plan</a>
        budget_extra: Perhaps you'd like us to hold on to this account for sometime, till you get your wallet back?
        requirement: Freshdesk does not handle some of my requirements
        requirement_followup: We are constantly adding more features and enhancements to Freshdesk. Have you tried suggesting your feature idea in our forums? Or perhaps what you’re looking for is just a few weeks away? <a href="https://support.freshdesk.com/support/discussions/forums/6">Browse our Forum</a>
        requirement_extra: Drop us a couple of lines on what you were looking for, and we'll try and move it up our queue real quick
        moving: We are moving to another product
        moving_followup: We really hate to see you go. Was it the features? The price? That bad bad marketing guy who keeps spamming you? But well, if you’ve made up your mind for someone else, we can only hope you’ll be back soon.
        moving_extra: A line or two on what made you switch would go a long way in helping us build a better product for you
        support: We did not receive good support
        support_followup: We’re sorry. As a customer support company, there’s nothing more important to us than giving you a great support experience, every time. We can only request you to give us another chance to make it up to you.
        support_extra: Give us a few more details and we'll make sure the right support rep repents. A ticket ID? Or Issue?
        else: Anything else?
        else_followup: A couple of lines explaining your problem would be nice..
        test-account: We were just using this account for testing. We'll be back

Round robin - Assign tickets to agents in a circular fashion<br>2. Load balanced - Set a limit on the number of tickets that are assigned to each agent<br>3. Skill based  - Assign tickets to agents based on their expertise <br/> <a href="https://support.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/196581" target="_blank">Read more</a>

      info9: Full time agents are those in your support team who will login to your help desk every day.
      info10: Occasional agents are those who would only need to login from time to time, such as your sales and marketing manager to take care of specific customer queries. You need not purchase an additional agent seat for a whole month for such agents.
      title3: Groups
      info11: You can organize agents into specific groups such as Sales and Product Management. Segmenting agents into divisions lets you easily assign tickets, create specific canned responses, manage workflows and generate group-level reports. Note that an agent can be a member of multiple groups.
      info12: An agent in Freshdesk is anybody who needs to access, work on and resolve your support tickets. The list shows all agents currently in your helpdesk. Hover over an agent to edit details, or click on New Agent to add a new agent. Agents you add will receive an email with a confirmation link to activate their account after which they can access and respond to tickets.
      info13: You can choose whether your agents will be accessing your support portal full-time, or be logging in only occasionally. Occasional agents will use up a Day Pass for each day they login to your support portal. You can purchase Day Passes in bulk from the Admin tab. Note that you will only be billed for the number of full-time agents you add in the plans and billing section.
      title4: Scopes and Roles
      info14: You can choose which tickets your agents can see by modifying their Ticket Scope. You should also specify what actions an agent is able to perform within your helpdesk by choosing a Role.
      info15: Note that you will not be able to either modify your own roles or delete yourself as an agent.

    info1: Business Hours give you more control over SLAs in your helpdesk, and when a ticket is due. For example, if your helpdesk works between 9am to 6pm Mon-Fri and a customer logs a ticket at 7pm on Tuesday, the "Due by" timers do not start ticking till Wednesday morning at 9
    info2: Holidays work exactly like business hours. If your helpdesk works between 9am to 6pm Mon-Fri and a customer sends a medium priority ticket at 8pm on Friday with a resolution time of 24 hours, then the ticket Due By time is set as 9am on Tuesday.(not 8pm on Sat)
    multiple_info: You can also create multiple sets of business hours and holidays, and apply them for specific groups. If you have one support team working on PST and another on GMT, you can let each group have its own set of business hours and holidays. <a href="https://support.freshdesk.com/solution/articles/98945" target="_blank">Learn more</a>

For example, having the customer’s order ID in an e-commerce setting helps bring up the right context to the ticket and speed things up a bit. You can customize your Ticket Form in Freshdesk to include the right ticket fields for your business, and let your customers and agents fill in the information you need in the format you want."

You can customize your Ticket Form to include the right ticket fields for your business, and let your customers and agents fill in the information you need in the format you want. For example, in an e-commerce company, getting a customer's order ID in the ticket form would be very helpful to the agent solving the ticket."
      info2: "Dependent Fields give you an easy way to create deeper ticket categories and identify the biggest issues that clog your support.  With dependent fields you can organize tickets hierarchically  into categories, subcategories and item affected."
      info4: "If you are in the estate plan or above, you can have dynamic fields that appear based on the option selected in the type field. For every option in the type field, you can create a different section. You can then add more ticket fields to each section. For example, in an ecommerce scenario, when the type is chosen as \"Replacement\", a section with a field called \"Reason\" can open up that will collect the reason why customer needs a replacement for the item. <a target='_blank' href='https://support.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/212889-creating-your-dynamic-ticket-forms'>Read more about dynamic fields</a>."

      info4_v3: "If you are in the Estate plan or above, you can have sections with dynamic fields appear based on the option selected in a dropdown field. You can add ticket fields to each section, and associate a section with options in the dropdown field. If you run an e-commerce store, for example, you can have a section open up with a field called 'Reason' when your customer chooses the option 'Replacement'. This way, you can better understand why your customer would like to have a replacement issued. You can create a maximum of two dynamic sections and use them in two custom dropdowns. If you've associated a section with the 'type' field already, you'll be able to add just one more section to the ticket form."

For example, you could have your customers calls forwarded to your Support team when they press 1, and to somebody from Sales when they press 2.<br/>Additionally, you can also customize the messages that will be played back to your customers by recording your voice, uploading a file or using the text-to-speech feature.<br><br><b>Customizing your number</b><br>You could also configure each and every phone number separately and let it have it’s own set of customizations. This includes basic settings such as the maximum number of people on the queue and maximum waiting time for your customers. Once either of them are reached, a non-availability message will be played to your customers automatically.<br/>When you enable call recording, every phone call across your helpdesk is recorded and attached to your tickets, and the recording can be publicly available to customers or kept private. You can also restrict your phone channel from taking calls during non-business hours. For example, you could set up two support lines, one of which will be available to take calls only during working hours, and another high-priority helpline that will be available 24x7.<br/><br/><a href='http://support.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/169198' target='_blank'>Read more about customizing your number</a>"

        body: "<p>Dear Customer Relations,</p><br /><p>I recently flew Upper Class from Heathrow to JFK and whilst some bits were great, one bit in particular was really really bad. I flew with my cat* and you froze** it and it died*** which made me sad****.</p><br /><p>* I use the word 'cat' in the sense of 'suitcase'.\n<br />** I use the word 'froze' in the sense of 'lost'.\n<br />*** I use the word 'died' in the sense of 'didn't turn up for 2 days'.\n<br />**** I use the word 'sad' correctly.</p><br /><p>We all lose things. I once went for a pint with the late Keith Floyd and he lost an entire week. Another time I worked out an equation for cold fusion and gave it to my cat on a memory stick, which she lost. Keith Floyd, me, my cat, and you are all only human, so these things happen. What separates humans from super humans is the way they deal with these hiccups.</p><br /><p>I won't bore you with the details. The only question is how can we make it right?</p><br /><p>Yours ever,\n<br />James Dean</p><p><hr></p><p>P.S.

        reply: "<p>Dear Mr James Dean (Like the Actor),</p><br /><p>Thank you for your email detailing your unfortunate events following the delay of your luggage. Please accept my sincerest apologies for this, and for the unexpected inconveniences caused as a result. I do hope that despite this, you had a pleasant trip.</p><br /><p>Thankfully, the following morning, it was me that you spoke to, and I advised you that your cat had been found and was on its way to you. On a serious note though James, I'm happy to give you a Tier Point. I hope you cherish it. Like it's Magic. I have also added the mileage and remaining tier points from your most recent flight with us, which means that you are now a Gold Member (not like the movie).</p><br /><p>Please once again accept my sincerest apologies. This experience is not typical of us, and I hope it has not discouraged you from travelling with us again, as it would certainly be a pleasure to welcome you back on board.</p><br /><p>Yours sincerely,\n<br />The Lady in Red\n<br />Baggage Services Advisor</p>"
