So, tickets that use Spanish as the request language can be mapped to the skill 'Fluent in Spanish'.<br><br>If the skill mapped to a ticket matches an agent's skill, the ticket will be assigned to the agent."

It lets you track support questions coming in through tweets that do not even mention your brand. If you are just starting out or have a support team that doubles up as your marketing team, you can even create a stream to monitor your business space and competitors. Click on the <b>New Stream</b> button to add a social stream, and customize it for your specific needs. For example, you can create a stream called \"Support\" and add your brand acronym and commonly used brand misspellings. All these tweets can be seen in your Social tab and you can reply to them using any of your integrated twitter accounts."

      The customer satisfaction survey is shown inside the email, and when customers choose a survey option, they will be taken to a page with the additional survey questions.
      The observer rules and gamification points will be based only on the customer satisfaction survey.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Point scales</b><br>
      You can choose different point scales for the customer satisfaction survey and additional survey questions. It could be<br>
      2 point (Eg: Yes, No)<br>
      3 point (Eg: Agree, Undecided, Disagree)<br>
      5 point (Eg: Always to Never)<br>
      7 point (Eg: Very Poor to Exceptional)<br><br>

      Once a customer takes the survey, the scales will be locked down and they cannot be edited.<br><br>
      You can learn more about satisfaction surveys from <a target= ‘_blank’ href='https://support.freshdesk.com/solution/articles/215321'>this solution article</a>.

        title1: Understanding Roles
        info1: Roles allow you to create and edit access permissions for agents. You can create new roles, specify what actions agents with these roles can perform within your help desk, and assign the role to agents.
        info2: For example, you can create a role for your Support Co-ordinators, allowing them to update fields and assign tickets, and even add notes internally, but not reply to customers.
        info3: Once you create and save a new Role you will be able to assign it to agents when you create or edit their profile by clicking on the Agents icon under the admin tab.
        title2: Admin Privileges
        info4: You can nominate whether you want an agent to have access to settings under the Admin tab. Agents with admin access can be Operation Agents with limited access, or Super Admins with the ability to edit all configurations. You can have as many Super Admins with the ability to view and modify your billing details, or as few as one.

      info4: The 'Edit Portal' option will let you configure the portal for your product.

        budget: I don’t have the budget anymore
        budget_followup: You can downgrade to a lower plan in Freshdesk without affecting your existing tickets. In fact, if the budget is really tight, you could move to the Sprout plan with 3 free agents for life. <a href="http://www.freshdesk.com/free-support-software">Learn more about the free plan</a>
        budget_extra: Perhaps you'd like us to hold on to this account for sometime, till you get your wallet back?
        requirement: Freshdesk does not handle some of my requirements
        requirement_followup: We are constantly adding more features and enhancements to Freshdesk. Have you tried suggesting your feature idea in our forums? Or perhaps what you’re looking for is just a few weeks away? <a href="https://support.freshdesk.com/support/discussions/forums/6">Browse our Forum</a>
        requirement_extra: Drop us a couple of lines on what you were looking for, and we'll try and move it up our queue real quick
        moving: We are moving to another product
        moving_followup: We really hate to see you go. Was it the features? The price? That bad bad marketing guy who keeps spamming you? But well, if you’ve made up your mind for someone else, we can only hope you’ll be back soon.
        moving_extra: A line or two on what made you switch would go a long way in helping us build a better product for you
        support: We did not receive good support
        support_followup: We’re sorry. As a customer support company, there’s nothing more important to us than giving you a great support experience, every time. We can only request you to give us another chance to make it up to you.
        support_extra: Give us a few more details and we'll make sure the right support rep repents. A ticket ID? Or Issue?

    tour: Help me automate a common scenario
    helptext: Scenario Automations let you carry out a bunch of updates to the ticket with a single click. They help you quickly handle recurring scenarios. For example, you could create a scenario to “Mark a Ticket as a Bug”, “Assign to the QA team” and send an email to the product manager so you can process customer reported bugs with a single click.
    available_placeholders: Insert Placeholders
    message_preview: Message Preview
    info2: For example before assigning a ticket to QA you may want to set the ticket type as Bug, assign it to the QA group and email the QA manager about the new bug.
    info3: Scenario Automation allows you to automate these actions in a single click
    info4: Click to insert Placeholders in the content which will dynamically get resolved into the appropriate data
    info5: Assign QA

Round robin - Assign tickets to agents in a circular fashion<br>2. Load balanced - Set a limit on the number of tickets that are assigned to each agent<br>3. Skill based  - Assign tickets to agents based on their expertise <br/> <a href="https://support.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/196581" target="_blank">Read more</a>

Segmenting agents into divisions lets you easily assign tickets, create specific canned responses, manage workflows and generate group-level reports.

Agents you add will receive an email with a confirmation link to activate their account after which they can access and respond to tickets.
      info13: You can choose whether your agents will be accessing your support portal full-time, or be logging in only occasionally. Occasional agents will use up a Day Pass for each day they login to your support portal. You can purchase Day Passes in bulk from the Admin tab. Note that you will only be billed for the number of full-time agents you add in the plans and billing section.
      title4: Scopes and Roles
      info14: You can choose which tickets your agents can see by modifying their Ticket Scope. You should also specify what actions an agent is able to perform within your helpdesk by choosing a Role.

    info1: Business Hours give you more control over SLAs in your helpdesk, and when a ticket is due. For example, if your helpdesk works between 9am to 6pm Mon-Fri and a customer logs a ticket at 7pm on Tuesday, the "Due by" timers do not start ticking till Wednesday morning at 9
    info2: Holidays work exactly like business hours. If your helpdesk works between 9am to 6pm Mon-Fri and a customer sends a medium priority ticket at 8pm on Friday with a resolution time of 24 hours, then the ticket Due By time is set as 9am on Tuesday.(not 8pm on Sat)
    multiple_info: You can also create multiple sets of business hours and holidays, and apply them for specific groups. If you have one support team working on PST and another on GMT, you can let each group have its own set of business hours and holidays. <a href="https://support.freshdesk.com/solution/articles/98945" target="_blank">Learn more</a>

      info1: "The ticket form is the easiest way to capture all the data you need from the customer, even as they submit a ticket. For example, having the customer’s order ID in an e-commerce setting helps bring up the right context to the ticket and speed things up a bit. You can customize your Ticket Form in Freshdesk to include the right ticket fields for your business, and let your customers and agents fill in the information you need in the format you want."
      info_1: "The ticket form helps capture the data you need from the customer when they submit a ticket. You can customize your Ticket Form to include the right ticket fields for your business, and let your customers and agents fill in the information you need in the format you want. For example, in an e-commerce company, getting a customer's order ID in the ticket form would be very helpful to the agent solving the ticket."
      info2: "Dependent Fields give you an easy way to create deeper ticket categories and identify the biggest issues that clog your support.  With dependent fields you can organize tickets hierarchically  into categories, subcategories and item affected."
      info4: "If you are in the estate plan or above, you can have dynamic fields that appear based on the option selected in the type field. For every option in the type field, you can create a different section. You can then add more ticket fields to each section. For example, in an ecommerce scenario, when the type is chosen as \"Replacement\", a section with a field called \"Reason\" can open up that will collect the reason why customer needs a replacement for the item. <a target='_blank' href='https://support.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/212889-creating-your-dynamic-ticket-forms'>Read more about dynamic fields</a>."
      info4_v2: "If you are in the estate plan or above, you can have dynamic fields that appear based on the option selected in the type field.

For example, in an ecommerce scenario, when the type is chosen as \"Replacement\", a section with a field called \"Reason\" can open up that will collect the reason why customer needs a replacement for the item."
      info4_v3: "If you are in the Estate plan or above, you can have sections with dynamic fields appear based on the option selected in a dropdown field. You can add ticket fields to each section, and associate a section with options in the dropdown field. If you run an e-commerce store, for example, you can have a section open up with a field called 'Reason' when your customer chooses the option 'Replacement'. This way, you can better understand why your customer would like to have a replacement issued. You can create a maximum of two dynamic sections and use them in two custom dropdowns. If you've associated a section with the 'type' field already, you'll be able to add just one more section to the ticket form."

          description: "My wifi has been down for two days now and there has been no response from your team on Twitter. Fix this soon or I'll move to a different ISP. I'm paying 120 dollars a month to be a priority service customer with Fiber connection as well. The router is a Black one from a couple of years back when I originally got the connection and only one of the lights on the router blinks now."

          description: "A few minutes into the washing cycle, my washing machine makes a loud whirring noise and comes to a grinding halt. This has happened a few times. Oddly enough, I've noticed this happening in the evenings. The whirring noise rarely occurs in the morning. Can there be a reason for it? Please send someone to check as soon as you can."

              Sounds like a drum issue to me, I would have to send a technician to your house to check it out. Could you pls confirm if ​this is your address: 7, Clinton St, Brooklyn Heights <br><br>
              Our records show that you live in a block of apartments. Can you tell me which floor your apartment is on? We'd like to know if a water pressure test needs to be conducted as well and if that's the case, I'll have to inform the field technician to bring the right equipment to your place to solve that issue. <br><br>
              Also, please let us know a few timeslots tomorrow when our technician can come visit. <br><br>        ​
              Thanks."
