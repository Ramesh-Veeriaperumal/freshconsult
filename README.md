# Freshconsult
Choose from range of consultant services andÂ schedule online appointment while sitting at home.

## Usage
Enable FSM and you will get new set of ticket fields and a new automation rule that will set the type of ticket as consultation type
 * Appointment time
 * Add Payment
 * Preffered Communication Type
 * Preffered Appointment Duration

The customer can create a new consultation ticket by visiting support portal with preffered appointment details along with other personal contact details.
The automation will run on the newly created ticket and will set the type as Consultation and hence few more new ticket fields will get added to the ticket.

When the agent will update the ticket with Appointment time and select the add payment check box
1. A payment link will be generated (using Paypal)
2. A zoom meeting will be created.
       Both payment link and meeting url are saved in schema_less_ticket serialised column.
3. A note is created with the payment link and the meeting url

Also a reminder notification service will be running in background which will notify (send mail) the end user(actual customer) and the consultant before 30 minutes of every appointment.
The customers will get periodic updates about their scheduled appointment.
