Hi,

The trusted IP security settings in your helpdesk has been enabled. Your helpdesk is now restricted to IPs between
<% @changes.each do |ip_range| %>
<%= ip_range["start_ip"] %>  -  <%= ip_range["end_ip"] %>
<% end %>
These modification were made at <%= @time %>.

If this change has been made without your authorization, send us a reply.

Thanks,
Freshdesk Customer Support
