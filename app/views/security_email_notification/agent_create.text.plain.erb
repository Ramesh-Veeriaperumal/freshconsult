Hi,

A new <%= @model.agent.occasional ? "Occasional" : "Full-time" %> agent, <%= @model.name %> was added in your helpdesk at <%= @time %> and has the <%= @changes.size > 1 ? "roles" : "role" %> <%= @changes.to_sentence %>.

You currently have <%= @model.account.all_agents.full_time_agents.size %> full time agents and <%= @model.account.all_agents.occasional_agents.size %> occasional agents in your Freshdesk account.

If this change has been made without your authorization, send us a reply.

Thanks,
Freshdesk Customer Support.
