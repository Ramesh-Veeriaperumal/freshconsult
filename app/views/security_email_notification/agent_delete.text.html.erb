Hi,<br><br>

An agent, <%= @model.name %> was deleted in your helpdesk at <%= @time %>. <%= @model.name %> will still exist in your helpdesk as a contact.
<br><br>
You currently have <%= @model.account.all_agents.full_time_agents.size %> full time agents and <%= @model.account.all_agents.occasional_agents.size %> occasional agents in your Freshdesk account.<br><br>

If this change has been made without your authorization, send us a reply.<br><br>

Thanks,<br>
Freshdesk Customer Support
