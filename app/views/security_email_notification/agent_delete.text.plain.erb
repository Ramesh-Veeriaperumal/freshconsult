Hi,

An agent, <%= @model.name %> was deleted by <%= @doer %> in your helpdesk at <%= @time %>. 
<%if @model.account.subscription.state.downcase.eql?('active')%>
To reflect this change in your billing, please update the agent information in the billing page. 
<%end%>
Note that <%= @model.name %> will still exist in your helpdesk as a contact.

You currently have <%= @model.account.all_agents.full_time_agents.size %> full time agents and <%= @model.account.all_agents.occasional_agents.size %> occasional agents in your Freshdesk account.

<%= render :partial => "footer_plain", :formats => [:html] %>
