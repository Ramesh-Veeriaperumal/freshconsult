		<strong>Top to bottom</strong>: The conversation thread is shown chronologically, with the last response at the bottom.

		<strong>No more endless scroll</strong>: Long ticket conversation threads are collapsed to just show the most recent three replies.

	<li>
		<strong>Send and Do Anything</strong>: Why stop with just “Send and Resolve” when you can now update ticket statuses to pending, closed or just anything when you send!
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Stuff where you need them</strong>: Insert Canned Responses and Suggested Solutions directly from reply area. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Easier, better, faster</strong>: Sticky ticket headers, sleeker agent collision warnings, and way faster page load time when you edit a ticket.
