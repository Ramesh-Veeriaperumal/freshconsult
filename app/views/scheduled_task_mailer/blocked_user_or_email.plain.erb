Hi <%= @user.name %>,

The scheduled report that you created for <%=@task.schedulable.filter_name%> was not sent to the following email address(es):

  <%@options[:blocked_emails].each do |email|%>
    <%= email %>
  <%end%>

This could be because of one of the following reasons:
	1.The contact associated with the email was deleted
  	2.The email address was deleted

You can update the email address(es) by clicking on the below link:
<%= "#{@user.account.full_url}/reports/v2/#{HelpdeskReports::Constants::Common::REPORT_ENUM_TO_TYPE[@task.schedulable.report_type]}"%>
