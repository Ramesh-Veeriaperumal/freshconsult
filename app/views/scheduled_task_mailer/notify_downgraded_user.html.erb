The scheduled report that you created for <b><%=@task.schedulable.filter_name%></b> is still being sent to the below agents who were deleted/ downgraded to contact recently: 
<br/>
<ol>
  <%@options[:agent_downgraded].each do |user|%>
    <li><%= user.email %></li>
  <%end%>
</ol>
<br/>

Please update the configuration if you wish to stop sending this report to the above emails in the future.<br/>
