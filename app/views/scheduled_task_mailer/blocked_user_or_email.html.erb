Hi <%= @user.name %>,

The scheduled report that you created for <b><%=@task.schedulable.filter_name%></b> was not sent to the following email address(es):

<br/>

<ol>
  <%@options[:blocked_emails].each do |email|%>
    <li><%= email %></li>
  <%end%>
</ol>
<br/>

This could be because of one of the following reasons:
<ol>
  <li>The contact associated with the email was deleted</li>
  <li>The email address was deleted</li>
</ol>
<br/>

You can update the email address(es) by clicking on the below link:<br/>
<%= "#{@user.account.full_url}/reports/v2/#{HelpdeskReports::Constants::Common::REPORT_ENUM_TO_TYPE[@task.schedulable.report_type]}"%>
