Hi <%=@admin_name%>,

The access token for your <%=@fb_page.page_name%> page has expired. This could be because
1. One of the admin's changed their facebook password.
2. One of the admin's has revoked some app permissions.
3. It has been 60 days since the last time you authorized the app. 

Please click on this link  <%=@facebook_url%> to reauthorize your facebook page and continue receiving facebook posts as tickets.

Regards,
