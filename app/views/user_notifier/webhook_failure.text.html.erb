Hi,<br/><br/>

The <%= @automation_type %> rule you configured to send API request to <%= @webhook_url %> has failed after several retries.

Please check and reconfigure the rule to avoid any loss of communication.<br/>

Rule: <%= @automation_name %> (<%= @automation_link %>)<br/><br/>

Regards,<br/>
