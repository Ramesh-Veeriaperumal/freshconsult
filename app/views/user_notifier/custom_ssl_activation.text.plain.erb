	Hi <%= @admin_name %>,


	Your request for a custom SSL certificate has been approved.

	We have already turned on Custom SSL in your portal, under Admin->Security. In order for it to work, please follow the steps below to update your CNAME records.


	1. Login to DNS Control Panel for the custom domain - <%= @portal_url %>. 

	2. Create a CNAME record under <%= @portal_url %> and point it to <%= @elb_name %>.

	3. Wait for a few hours for the changes to take effect.


	
	 Once ready, your support portal at <%= @portal_url %> will be secure thanks to the new SSL certificate. 

	 
	Regards
	Freshdesk Support
