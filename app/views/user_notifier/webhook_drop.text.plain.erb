Hi,

A webhook that was scheduled 24 hours ago for execution has now been dropped since you consistently exceeded your API rate limits.

If you wish to prevent this from happening again, mail us at support@freshdesk.com to raise your API limits. To learn more about how we support webhooks and why we drop them, click here https://support.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/217264-webhooks-faq.
