== Welcome to the Helpdesk Rails Kit

This kit contains everything you need to add a fully-functional
helpdesk to your rails application.

* Automatically converts incoming email and contact form requests
  into tickets, which can be assigned to individual members of your
  team.

* Keeps a record of all incoming and outgoing customer
  correspondence.

* Lets you view all recent customer support activity at a glance.

* A built in bayesian spam filter keeps your inbox free and saves
  you time.

* A searchable knowledgebase lets you easily add FAQs and user
  manuals to your website.


== Installation

0. Install the required gems: sudo gem install mms2r
1. Unzip the Helpdesk kit archive to the desired directory.
2. Edit config/database.yml like you would for any rails project.
3. Run "rake bootstrap" from your project root.
4. Configure email in /config/helpdesk.yml (see instructions below)
5. Run the mail fetcher daemon: "script/helpdesk_mail_fetcher"
6. Log in to the new helpdesk at "http://yourapp.com/helpdesk", with 
   username "admin" and the password displayed near the end of
   the migration from running the bootstrap task.
   

== Running the Test Suite (optional)

0. Install the required gems: sudo gem install thoughtbot-shoulda mocha
1. Make sure that you've created the test database
2. Run "rake test" like you normally would


== Routes

The "back end" of your helpdesk is located at
http://yourapp.com/helpdesk. This is where your staff will go to
take care of business.

Your "front end" customer service portal is located at
http://yourapp.com/service. This is where your customers will go to
get help.


== Configure Outgoing Email

Outgoing email is sent via Rails' built-in ActionMailer class. You
can configure it using the options defined in ActionMailer::Base:

[ http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html ]

You can make these changes to the EMAIL:outgoing section of 
"config/helpdesk.yml".


== Configure Incoming Email

The Helpdesk Kit includes a mail fetching daemon that pulls incoming
email from an IMAP or POP account every few minutes.

The configuration for incoming email is located in
"config/helpdesk.yml". If you peek into that file, you'll find
several examples for both POP and IMAP.

The mail fetching daemon is located in
"script/helpdesk_mail_fetcher.rb". It's easy to run it:

    To start the daemon:    script/helpdesk_mail_fetcher.rb start
    To stop the daemon:     script/helpdesk_mail_fetcher.rb stop
    To restart the daemon:  script/helpdesk_mail_fetcher.rb restart

Once started, the daemon will run in the background, and shouldn't
require any additional work on your end. We do, however, recommend
using a process monitoring utility such as monit to make sure that
the process is restarted if it is ever interrupted.

== Customize Email Templates

The Helpdesk's email templates are simply ActionMailer templates. 

    "app/views/helpdesk/ticket_notifier/reply.text.plain.erb" - This
    template is used when you or one of your staff sends a reply to
    a customer. The default contains a footer with a link that the
    user can follow to see the ticket's status

    "app/views/helpdesk/ticket_notifier/autoreply.text.plain.erb" -
    When the customer initiates a support request, an autoreply is
    sent to their email address. This template is used to generate
    that autoreply.


== Other Configuration Options

All of the following configuration options are located in
"config/helpdesk.yml".

Spam:
    SPAM_TRAINING_MODE: When set to true, the helpdesk will not automatically
    classify incoming requests as spam/ham. The spam filter is pretty dumb
    out of the box. It only becomes more effective when you train it, by 
    manually flagging posts as spam. In order to prevent legitimate requests
    from being classified as spam, you should leave this option set to true
    for a while. 

Page Titles:
    STAFF_FACING_TITLE: This is the title for the staff-facing back
    end of your helpdesk
    USER_FACING_TITLE: This is the title for your end-user-facing
    customer-service portal
    
Salt Values (Used in generating unique ticket tokens):
    SECRET_1: a random value
    SECRET_2: a random value

WYSIWYG editor options:
    EDITOR_OPTIONS: Customize the appearance of TinyMCE [ http://github.com/kete/tiny_mce/tree/master ]

User permissions:
    ROLES: Defines the permissions granted to each role.



== Integrating Your User System

The Helpdesk Kit makes use of the User model that probably already
exists in your application.

Here's the good news: if you decide to use the
restful_authentication plugin included with this kit, you don't have
to do anything.

If you want to use a different user system, it's easy to make your
current user system compatible with the Helpdesk Kit.

Just do the following:

    1) Make sure that your user model has a "name" field
    2) Provide a method "current_user" in the application controller
    and as a helper. It should return the current user record, if
    one is logged in. If no user is logged in, it should return nil.


== Adding Authorized Users

Once your user system is set up you can start adding authorized users.

To be added as an authorized helpdesk user, the user account must
already exist. User creation isn't handled by the helpdesk.

To add accounts

    1) Go to the helpdesk: http://yoursite.com/helpdesk 
    2) Click on the "users" link at the top right corner of your
       screen.
    3) Type the name into the search box. Select one from the list
       of choices.
    4) Adjust the account's priveleges using the select box.


* IMPORTANT NOTE: If you delete all of the authorizations, your
  helpdesk is wide open. Any user can perform admin actions. So be
  sure to always have at least one authorized user.


== Customizing Your Customer Service Portal

If you look in the routes.rb file, you may notice that we have two namespaces.

    1) http://yoursite.com/helpdesk/* - This is the "back end" of
    the helpdesk, the part your staff sees. It's here that you'll be
    able to view, assign and respond to user queries. While you're
    more than welcome to customize this area, most people won't.
    (And that's OK)

    2) http://yoursite.com/support/* - This is the "front end" of
    your helpdesk, the part your customers see. Chances are good
    that you'll want to style this area to match the overall design
    of your website. Views are located in "/app/views/support".


== Integrating the helpdesk into an existing product or website using an iframe.

The MinimalTicketsController is used for ticket creation via
a stripped down web-form. On submission, it displays a thank-you
message and does not redirect to the user's "my requests" area.
This is useful if you're incorporating the helpdesk into your
product using an iframe.
