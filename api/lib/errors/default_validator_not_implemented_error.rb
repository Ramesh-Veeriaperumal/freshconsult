class DefaultValidatorNotImplementedError < StandardError
  # API Validators are developed to provide enhanced error messages and
  # custom_codes to the users for clear understanding. Validations that are
  # possible in default validators can be achieved using the API Validators,
  # as a result API Validators wont support the default ones.
  # Please extend if you have such requirement.
